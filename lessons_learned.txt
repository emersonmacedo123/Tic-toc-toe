the matrix has to be more universal (bigger than 3,3)
all of the system of the game also has to be bigger 

use enum to validate_user_input

get_move
	use index in a list [ABC] and use it to check 
	indexof (double check it)
	it gets the limit bigger (usage of the whole alphabet) 

mark
	try to use the mark based on the character not on the player 
	one function -> one functionality 
	if we are using 'and' probably i've broken the principle 
	        if player == "P1":
            board[row][col] = "X"
        else:
            board[row][col] = "0"
print_board
	use for to make it universal 

print_result
	does not need to have "if winner is true"
	only "if winner"
	otherwise -> 
	else not needed always 

tictactoe_game -> 
	get it smaller 
	use blocks and blank lines every now and thene 
	use comments as well to better explain it 

draw.io -> better to export and comfmortable to use 
lucidchart -> another alternative
